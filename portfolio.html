    <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>In this project, the goal was to creat a playable game with choices for the player. The game my partner, Dindi Santos, and I created was able to meet that goal, all while looking aesthetically pleasing, having an intersting story, and running smoothly. The story of the game was brief and engaging; it was about a small group of two birds that go around helping other animals. The game's programming consisted of many broadcasted signals that triggered event that would further the story, and lists that kept the available stories seperate from each other. Each of the broadcasts were given specific names that would indicate what they shoud be triggering and mixed with the lists, they acted as one-way-flags to prevent going backwards in the story. Nesting, putting one inside the other, several if-then's was also key to the functionality of the game; incorporating it with different variables that would be put in list made other one-way-flags. 
        Although the games was fully-functioning and I was able to learn how to make choice dependent events within Scratch, the game was lacking a few areas. The animations could have been made smoother using blocks to creat flying, walking, and talking animations for each of the characters. More user interactions could have been added as well,rather then having simple point and click choices.
