    <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>In this project, the goal was to create a playable game with choices for the player. The game my partner, Dindi Santos, and I created was able to meet that goal, all while looking aesthetically pleasing, having an intersting story, and running smoothly. The story of the game was brief and engaging; it was about a small group of two birds that go around helping other animals. The game's programming consisted of many broadcasted signals that triggered event that would further the story, and lists that kept the available stories seperate from each other. Each of the broadcasts were given specific names that would indicate what they shoud be triggering and mixed with the lists, they acted as one-way-flags to prevent going backwards in the story. Nesting, putting one inside the other, several if-then's was also key to the functionality of the game; incorporating it with different variables that would be put in list made other one-way-flags. 
        Although the games was fully-functioning and I was able to learn how to make choice dependent events within Scratch, the game was lacking a few areas. The animations could have been made smoother using blocks to creat flying, walking, and talking animations for each of the characters. More user interactions could have been added as well,rather then having simple point and click choices.

    <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p> The goal of this project was to use the MIT App Inventor with block coding to create Quizzer,the app me and my partner Tiffany Gunawan came up with. This app was made to help students keep track of all their vocabulary words, similar to Quizlit, but ours had a game to help. The game would randomly select a word of a list and give several definitions of the same list for the user to match from. The user was able to create and adjust sets of words before playing the game and choosing which list to be quizzed on.
        These actions were accomplished through the usage of several screens:the home screen, list making screen, list editing screen, and the game screen. These screens consisted of global variables made to help when it came to combining smaller lists,the term and definition, into bigger lists, the set of vocabulary words. The sets were then saved in tiny data bases so they could be accessed later in other screens. Though the app made the basic requirements, if given the time, my partner and I would have made Quizzer more user friendly and would have figured out how to randomize where the answer to the term would be.

    <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to create a story in python whose ending was decision-dependent. My partner, Jackie, and I came up with a medievil story that took the user on an adventure through a dungeon as a king-appointed knight set on conquering a ferocious beast. In that story comes multiple decisions regarding a farmer and pyromancer that can join the knight's party and assist in killing the beast. The story's coding is simplistic and consists of various if-else functions that allow the story to branch off depending on the choice made. The user needs only to type one of the two letters provided when told it is time to make a decision. Were I able to continue adjusting this story, I would make the story's branching off points more complicated and connected to one another with more endings, and make it so if the user types in something other than what is prompted the program will repeat the prompt until given an acceptable answer.

    <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>In this project, Austin Holland and I were able choose among several game-like ideas to create into a program using python. We chose to make a langauge translator that would translate from English to our own made-up language, Folk Brother, and vice versa. The coding of the prgram consists of two dictionaries of the language key, one that goes from English to FB and one that goes the other way, a list that appears to the user as a langauge key, and four functions. The translate function prompts the user to choose which language they want to translate to, the lowerChar function simply defines 'char' and allows a translated phrase to be returned, the english function translates from English to Folk Brother, and lastly the fb function translates from Folk Brother to English. Both the fb and english functions check the raw input provided by the user to ensure it only contains characters on one side of the key, depending on the language chosen, and if those characters are lowercase in the case of typing in English. They also allow for the user to switch which language they are typing in after each translation. A few things I would add if given the opportunity, would be a test function and a function that stops the translating loop all together.
